> Contribution Guidelines

We use [pre-commit by Yelp][yelp] to handle code linting, security checks, and
running our tests pre-push. We would appreciate it if you used this tool before
committing to the project.

We use [our own published Help Scout standards][standards]. These are PSR2 plus
a small collection of other preferences. Our code is PSR2 compliant, but not
all PSR2 code is Help Scout compliant.
